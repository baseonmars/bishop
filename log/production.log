/trunk/flash/sitemaker/render/src/as/com/greekattic/render/ContainerRender.as\r\n\r\nWIP: Membership, login/register changes\r\n-----\r\n\r\n* Container now logs user out of Facebook AND site when logout is called, by detecting if there's a facebook connection and the user is facebook linked to the site.\r\n\r\n* Got error messages working for new Facebook login/register views\r\n\r\n* No longer using SWFAddress to check query string for an email address as it was crashing, calling ExternalInterface now.\r\n\r\n----\r\n* AbstractMembershipAction.as\r\n - added ability in checkEmail() to specify an email field. 'email' is used as default if none specified\r\n\r\n* CheckUserStatus.as\r\n - Using ExternalInterface to call SM.getQueryString to check for email parameter on query string. This is alternative to using SWFAddress\r\n\r\n* RegisterFacebookUser.as\r\n - Now capturing registration failure cases so that we can bounce back to details screen to show error messages\r\n\r\n* StoreFacebookDetailsAction.as\r\n - updated to pass 'emailNew' to be used as the email field in checkEmail(), as noted above by the change in AbstractMembershipAction.as\r\n\r\n* RegisterWithExternalView.as\r\n - Adding m_email to the list of fields that are errorable\r\n\r\n* RegisterWithFacebookView.as\r\n - Now sets focus on first field when there are no errors - for usability\r\n - Now prefills fields with existing data on return to the view\r\n - If there are errors, the original Facebook authentication message is replaced with generic error message as it makes no sense for user to see that again.\r\n\r\n* IUser.as\r\n - added new methods setFacebookID() and hasFacebookLink()\r\n   if user has link to facebook, they will have an ID stored against them in the DB, this is used\r\n   in ContainerRender to detect if there is a link\r\n\r\n* User.as\r\n - implemented new methods from IUser.as\r\n\r\n* ContainerInit.as\r\n - storing facebook user id in current user object, which now comes back from Container.cgi -> startup()\r\n\r\n* ContainerRender.as\r\n - Now using new call to IUser->hasFacebookLink() and ExternalInterface call to SM.FBConect.isConnected in the Javascript to detect if user is logged in with facebook, so we can call the JS to logout of Facebook and site together, else do normal log out.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nr12934 | gruff | 2009-04-09 17:34:33 +0100 (Thu, 09 Apr 2009) | 1 line\r\nChanged paths:\r\n   M

IContainerEdit.as sits within the common folder and IToolBar sits within Toolbar folder. The compile of RenderResources thus fails to find this class. To remedy this, IToolBar was moved into a new folder: 'toolbar' under common/src/as/com/greekattic/sitemaker, so that it can be found by the build. IToolbar.as had a method initialize() which referenced SM4Conditions in its arguments list, which in turn referenced a whole load of classes which don't need to be known in the common area and continued to cause compile errors.\r\n\r\nSo the initialize() method was removed from IToolbar interface and its functionality was implemented in ToolbarFactory.as where the new instance of an IToolbar is created. So ToolBarLoader.as no longer makes a call to the now deprecated initialize() function.\r\n\r\n----\r\n* IToolBar.as\r\n - Deleted from sitemaker/toolbar\r\n - Moved to new folder common/src/as/com/greekattic/toolbar\r\n - Removed initialize() method from interface\r\n\r\n* ToolBarFactory.as\r\n - Initialising the newly created instance of the toolbar\r\n\r\n* ToolBarLoader.as\r\n - No longer calling initialize() on the new instance of the IToolbar as that initialistion is performed within ToolBarFactory.as when the toolbar is created (as above)\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nr13657 | eirik | 2009-06-03 18:44:40 +0100 (Wed, 03 Jun 2009) | 1 line\r\nChanged paths:\r\n   M /trunk/partner/icatchdesigns/config/icatchdesigns.sql\r\n   M /trunk/partner/portfoliovillage/config/portfoliovillage.sql\r\n   M /trunk/partner/smoothbuild/config/smoothbuild.sql\r\n   M /trunk/partner/tinypricewebsites/config/tinypricewebsites.sql\r\n\r\nCorrected Partner SQL configs\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nr13658 | eirik | 2009-06-03 18:45:28 +0100 (Wed, 03 Jun 2009) | 1 line\r\nChanged paths:\r\n   A /trunk/sitemaker/db/generate_db_scripts/standard_price_groups.sql\r\n\r\nJoe's new set of standard prices (generated from Excel sheet)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nr13659 | eirik | 2009-06-03 18:50:16 +0100 (Wed, 03 Jun 2009) | 1 line\r\nChanged paths:\r\n   A /trunk/sitemaker/db/prices_sql_generator.xls\r\n\r\nExcel sheet to generate SQL to insert prices\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nr13660 | gruff | 2009-06-04 10:12:20 +0100 (Thu, 04 Jun 2009) | 1 line\r\nChanged paths:\r\n   M /trunk/sitemaker/db/alter/49_up_R4.26/sp_ReportAdWordVoucherRequests.sql\r\n\r\nPartial fix for bug 3058: A hard-coded date had crept in from a test version of the query instead of getdate().

Turns out the perl expects an implicit sort order on the returned result set and breaks if the data is returned in a different order.  Clustered indices change implied sort order when none is enforced and as the table is built recursively, it isn't possible to reproduce the original sort order with an ORDER BY clause. This solution is fragile as implicit sort orders are not guaranteed but it simply returns it to the way it used to work and since it's legacy (message board) it probably isn't worth making it more robust.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nr13935 | gruff | 2009-07-08 18:00:41 +0100 (Wed, 08 Jul 2009) | 1 line\r\nChanged paths:\r\n   M /trunk/sitemaker/db/alter/50_up_R4.26.2/sp_add_partner.sql\r\n\r\nI've changed the default value of the namespace scope to be site-level as it was still defaulting to partner-level.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nr13938 | gruff | 2009-07-09 13:18:52 +0100 (Thu, 09 Jul 2009) | 1 line\r\nChanged paths:\r\n   M /trunk/sitemaker/db/alter/50_up_R4.26.2/build.xml\r\n   A /trunk/sitemaker/db/alter/50_up_R4.26.2/sp_convert_comm_to_site_level.sql\r\n\r\nAdded an update to sp_convert_comm_to_site_level to fix bug 3104.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nr13939 | gruff | 2009-07-09 14:12:41 +0100 (Thu, 09 Jul 2009) | 1 line\r\nChanged paths:\r\n   M /trunk/sitemaker/db/alter/50_up_R4.26.2/sp_convert_comm_to_site_level.sql\r\n\r\nfixed a bug -
